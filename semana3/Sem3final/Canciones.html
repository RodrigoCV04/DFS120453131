        <h1>So done</h1>
        Okay, I realize now <br>
        That everything that I did was wrong <br>
        Okay, I realize now <br>
        Some things are better off said than done <br> 
        Okay, I realize now <br>
        That maybe I'm not ready for love <br>
        Okay, I realize now <br>
        I finished us before we begun-un-un <br> 
        I'm done, so done <br>
        I'm done with all the games you play <br> 
        I'm numb, so numb <br>
        I'm numb to all the pain you bring <br>
        I'm tryna figure this all out for myself <br>
        I don't need you or nobody else <br>
        I'm done, so done <br>
        So done, so done, so done, so done <br>
        I'm done (oh no, no-no-no, no-no-no) <br>
        I think that it's time for you to realize <br>
        That I'm not gon' be here forever but <br>
        I Wish that I was, but you were the cause <br>
        For every lit feelin' I'm feeling aside <br>
        Sometimes I sit and I think about why <br>
        I even trusted you, shit unsurprisin'<br>
        I'm walkin' away from you, it's about time <br>
        Want you to walk out and walk out of my life <br>
        And you, yeah, yo <br>
        You stay on my mind way more than I would like for you <br>
        And you, yeah you <br>
        The reason I can't find no love, don't wanna find no one <br>
        I'm done, so done <br>
        I'm done with all the games you play <br>
        I'm numb, so numb <br>
        I'm numb to all the pain you bring <br>
        I'm tryna figure this all out for myself <br>
        I don't need you or nobody else <br>
        I'm done, so done <br>
